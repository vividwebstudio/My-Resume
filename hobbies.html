    <h1>My Hobbies & Interests</h1>
      <ul>
        <p>Welcome to a glimpse into what I enjoy doing when I'm not focused on work. These<br />
        activities help me relax, learn new things, and stay creative.</p>
      </ul>
      <hr />

      <ul>
    <li><h2>Reading</h2></li>        
        <p>I am an avid reader and love exploring new worlds, ideas, and characters through books.
           From classic literature to modern science fiction, I enjoy getting lost in a good story. I find
           that reading not only provides an escape but also broadens my perspective and
           vocabulary.</p>
      </ul>
      <hr />


      <ul>
    <li><h2>Hiking and Exploring</h2></li>
          <p>There's nothing quite like getting outdoors and exploring nature. Whether it's a challenging<br />
             mountain trail or a peaceful walk through a local park, I love the sense of adventure and<br />
             the opportunity to disconnect from technology. It's a great way to stay active, clear my<br />
             head, and appreciate the beauty of the world around me.</p>
      </ul>
      <hr>

    <ul>
    <li><h2>Cooking and Baking</h2></li>
      <p>I'm passionate about experimenting in the kitchen. I find immense satisfaction in creating<br />
         delicious meals from scratch, whether I'm trying a complex new recipe or simply preparing<br />
         a comforting dish. There's a special joy in sharing food you've made with friends and<br />
         family.</p>
    </ul>
    <hr />

      <ul>
    <li><h2>Photography</h2></li>
          <p>I enjoy capturing moments in time with my camera. Photography has taught me to pay<br />
             more attention to the details of everyday lifeâ€”the way light hits a building, the patterns in<br />
             nature, or the emotion on a person's face. It's a creative outlet that allows me to see the<br />
             world from a different perspective.</p>
      </ul>
